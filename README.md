# notepad_plus_plus_EKL_language_color_style
This is color highlighting palette for Notepad++ for the scripting language Enterprise Knowledge Language (EKL) within the 3DEXPERIENCE Platform by Dassault Systemes.
I created this mainly to help myself due to some performance issues I was facing with the IDE integrated in the platform.

IMPORTANT: I do not claim any ownership nor authorship of the Enterprise Knowledge Language. EKL is property of Dassault Systemes (https://3ds.com).
